<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>Achievment Friendly Furniture Pack (or AFFP) is a fork from the NDM model, by MrFrog. With it, you can use furniture without even installing mods or addons in Minecraft Bedrock Edition!</p>
<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p>The Armor Stand is a entity in Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and, thankfully to the Molang Resources, you're able to change the geometry and the texture of the Armor Stand by changing it's name. Using that, you can have furniture just by changing the Armor Stand name with a tag!</p>
<h1>How to use</h1>
<p>First step, you need to rename the tag in a anvil with the name of the specific furniture.</p>
<p>After that, just name the Armor Stand with your tag, and thats it!</p>
<p>Down below, I will left the list for every single furniture. By now, there are 6. This list will grow over time.</p>
